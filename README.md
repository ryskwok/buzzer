# buzzer
Script to auto-click buzzer (buzzin.live) as soon as it's enabled.

## What is this for?
I've been playing Jeopardy weekly with friends, where we've been using a buzzer (http://buzzin.live/) to "buzz" in for an answer,  and discovered I have an awful reaction time. Decided to write a script to click the buzzer as soon as the buzzer is unlocked or enabled.

## How does it work?
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to the buzzin.live game link
3. Open console
4. Paste the Javascript
5. When ready (e.g. you know the answer to Jeopardy) hit Enter

## How much testing has been done?
None. Will report back with updates.
